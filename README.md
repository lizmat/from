NAME
====

from - load a module and import selected items from it

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use from <Test &plan &ok>;  # only import "plan" and "ok"

plan 1;
ok "foo", "bar";  # ok 1 - bar

use from "Foo";  # use Foo, but don't import anything

use from <Test ! &skip>;  # import everything *except* skip
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

from is a helper module that allows you to load any given module and only import selected items from whatever that module imports. This can be helpful when there is a conflict between different modules exporting something with the same name (such as `skip` in the Raku core, and the `skip` subroutine provided by `Test`.

The first argument indicates the name of the module to be loaded. If it is the only argument, then the module will be loaded without doing **any** of its imports (which is basically the same as `need`).

If the second argument is a sole exclamation mark, it indicates that the rest of the arguments are items that should **not** be imported.

The rest of the arguments indicate the items that should (not) be imported.
